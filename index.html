      <b>Abstract:</b>
      In computational creativity, digital arts, most in two dimension (2D) canvas, has been a dominating topic where
      evolution algorithms have recently shown great quality and efficiency.
      However, going from 2D to three dimension (3D) where computational approaches empowers creation of 3D art remains
      an open field.
      In this work, we extend the boundary of evolutionary algorithms to computational creativity in the spatial 3D art,
      by bridge evolution strategies (ES) and 3D rendering through customizable parameterization of scenes.
      We demonstrate that our approach is capable of placing semi-transparent triangles in 3D scenes that, when viewing
      from specific angles, renders into films that looks like what humans understand natural language.
      The flexibility to customize scenes allows a new way for the artist to express creativity ideas.

    <h2> Evaluation 1: </h2>

      <i>This corresponds to the</i> <b class="bolditalic">Figure 1</b> <i>in the paper, which shows the following: </i>
      Our proposed method places semi-transparent triangles in three dimension (3D) spaces using Evolution
      Strategies.
      Leveraging ray-tracing based rendering Mitsuba 3,
      the rendered film at possibly multiple cameras is compared with its corresponding, user-specified text prompt
      using distance between their representation embedded by CLIP.
      Such distances, aggregate by average, are used as the fitness in sense of Evolution Strategies, which optimize the
      parameters of triangles to archive better finesses.
